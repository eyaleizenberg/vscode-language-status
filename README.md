# VScode Language Status
This extension shows you the current system language in the status bar of VScode.

## But why?
This extension is very useful if you have more than one system language and then you start typing in the editor but you get the wrong language. This is especially useful if you are using the VIM VScode extension as the VIM commands will not work if your keyboard is currently set to Hebrew for example.
